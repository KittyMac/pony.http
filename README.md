# pony.http


**WARNING**

This was a fun experiment in learning and writing a bare-bones, highly performant http server in Pony.  However, now that [the old, semi-official http server is being replaced with a new, better http server](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/190363-projects/topic/http) I have decided to switch over to using that combined with [Jennet](https://github.com/Theodus/jennet).

I am leaving this repository here for the time being, but I imagine that some point in the not too distant future it will be archived.
